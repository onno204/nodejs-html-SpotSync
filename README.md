# SpotSync

*NOTE: This was usefull before spotify introduced 'jams'(aka listen together). Using this app is was possible to listen together to the same song and sync play progress*

How it works:

The interface is connected to the server through a websocket.
After you granted spotsync acces to your account it will look +- every 2 seconds if you're playing a song. 
If so, it looks if anyone is listing along and sync the time & song. It also sends a websocket update to every connected websocket.
